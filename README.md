# Sega 32X 240p Test Suite

![240pMars](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/820735/183469220-d99b9c1e-6b77-451d-a5d6-61bef62e04f3.png)

A homebrew software suite specifically designed for the Sega 32X. Developed to help in the evaluation of capture cards, upscarelers, upscan converters, line doublers, and TV processing of 240p video and scan signals.

It consists of tests designed with the processing of 240p signals in mind, although when possible it includes other video modes and specific tests for them. These have been tested with video processors on real hardware and a variety of displays, including CRTs, PVMs, BVMs and Arcade monitors via RGB.

As a secondary target, the suite aims to provide tools for calibrating colors, geometry, linearity, overscan and black & white levels, for specific console outputs and setups.

This test suite is based on Artemio Urbina's 240p Test Suite.

This software is open source and free.
